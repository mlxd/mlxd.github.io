# Q. How do available FFT routines compare over different libraries and accelerator hardwares?
---
This is something I have wondered for sometime, though it can be difficult for an apples-to-apples comparison. I will consider the above question in relation to the following plan:

***Comparing FFT implementations in a pseudospectral solver for linear and nonlinear Schrodinger equation dynamics***

To decide on how to proceed, it is instructive to list all (or most) widely known and used implementations. 

## Standard implementations

### [CPU]

- IBM TrueNorth FFT: No link/source found (yet)
- Rigetti pyQuil quantum FFT: http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html (currently emulated AFAIK, but will eventually/hopefully run directly on quantum hardware)

## Test cases
To ensure sufficient time is spent in the FFT routines I will opt for a 2D transform of an NxN grid, requiring N transforms, a transpose, and another N. The value of N can be scaled to determine sweet spots for all implementations. Granted, memory size will be the determining factor of how large we can go. $N=2^j$ where $j \in \mathbb{Z}, 7 \leq j \leq 11$ is a reasonable range of values to examine that should fit readily on most hardware.

For this, the following test precisions will be instructive:

- $\mathbb{C}2\mathbb{C}$ - 32-bit float (32-bits for each real and imaginary component)


- $\mathbb{C}2\mathbb{C}$ - 64-bit float 
- $\mathbb{R}2\mathbb{C}$ - 32-bit float
- $\mathbb{R}2\mathbb{C}$ - 64-bit float


As a sample system to investigate, I will consider the case of a quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). To investigate dynamics and their resulting accuracy, a known and analytically calculable result is useful. For this, I will opt for a a superposition state of the groundstate along the $xy$ plane, and the first excited state along $x$ with the groundstate along $y$. To put things more formally:

$$
\Psi(x,y) = \frac{ \Psi\_{00}(x,y) + \Psi\_{10}(x,y) }{\sqrt{2}}.
$$
To construct the above wavefunction we will assume that the states $\Psi\_{00}(x,y)$ and $\Psi\_{10}(x,y)$ are outer products of the solutions to the QHO, as given by:

$$
\Psi\_n(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}n!}}\left(\frac{m\omega\_x}{\pi\hbar}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}}\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{m\omega\_x x^2}{2\hbar}}H\_n(x),
$$
where $$
H\_n(x)=(-1)^n\mathrm{e}^{x^2}\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\left(\mathrm{e}^{-x^2}\right),$$ 
are the [physicists' Hermite polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials). As we are looking for the ground and first excited states ($n=0,1$) we can simplify a lot of the above calculations: $H\_0(x)=1$ and $H\_0(x)=2x$. Next, we determine the states $\Psi\_0(x)$ and $\Psi\_1(x)$ as:

$$ \begin{eqnarray}
\Psi\_0(x) = \left(\frac{m\omega\_x}{\pi\hbar}\right)^\frac{1}{4}\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{m\omega\_x x^2}{2\hbar}},~
\Psi\_1(x) = \frac{2x}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\frac{m\omega\_x}{\pi\hbar}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}}\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{m\omega\_x x^2}{2\hbar}}.
\end{eqnarray}
$$

Along a single dimension, our system can potentially be in any of the allowed harmonic oscillator states. Therefore, the overall state is given by a tensor product of the state along $x$ and that along $y$. If we assume the dimensionality of the Hilbert space along the $i$-th orthogonal spacial index is finite and given by $d_i$, then the overall system dimensionality (ie the total number of states we can consider) is $d = \displaystyle\prod\_{i} d\_i$.

Assuming an $n$-dimensional system, where each individual dimension is in the groundstate of the harmonic oscillator, we can define the tensor product state as
$$
\Psi\_n = \Psi\_0^{\otimes n} = \Psi\_0 \otimes \Psi\_0  \cdots \otimes \Psi\_0.
$$

While the above is fine for a general case, for the purposes of FFTs we have assumed a much simpler system, dealing with combinations of only 2 states. We can then define them as $\Psi\_{00}(x,y) = \Psi\_{0}(x)\otimes\Psi\_{0}(y)$ and $\Psi\_{10}(x,y) = \Psi\_{1}(x)\otimes\Psi\_{0}(y)$. Thus, our final superposition state when filling everything in is given by
$$
\Psi(x,y) = \left(\frac{m}{\pi\hbar}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\left(\omega\_x\omega\_y\right)^{\frac{1}{4}}\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{m}{2\hbar}\left(\omega\_x x^2 + \omega\_y y^2\right)}\left(x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right).
$$


For a more detailed explanation and approach to the above have a look at Christina Lee's ([albi3ro](https://github.com/albi3ro)) blog post on [time evolution](http://albi3ro.github.io/M4//prerequisites%20required/Time-Evolution.html), which will cover the method I use next.
