abstract = "The simulation of quantum circuits using the tensor network method is very computationally demanding and requires significant High Performance Computing (HPC) resources to find an efficient contraction order and to perform the contraction of the large tensor networks. In addition, the researchers want a workflow that is easy to customize, reproduce and migrate to different HPC systems. In this paper, we discuss the issues associated with the deployment of the QuantEX quantum computing simulation software within containers on different HPC systems. Also, we compare the performance of the containerized software with the software running on bare metal. "
