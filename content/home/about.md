# Biography

I am a PhD graduate of the [Quantum Systems Unit](https://groups.oist.jp/qsu) at [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Japan](https://oist.jp). My PhD research included control and manipulation of quantum states, GPU and next-generation computing, and nonlinear dynamics. I am an author of the Bose-Einstein condensate simulation suite [GPUE](https://github.com/gpue-group/GPUE). Currently I am investigating the use of prototype exascale computing technologies for femtosecond X-ray crystallography (XFEL) of bio-molecular systems.
