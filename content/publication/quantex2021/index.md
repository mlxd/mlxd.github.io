abstract = "Tensor network methods are incredibly effective for simulating quantum circuits. This is due to their ability to efficiently represent and manipulate the wave-functions of large interacting quantum systems. We describe the challenges faced when scaling tensor network simulation approaches to Exascale compute platforms and introduce QuantEx, a framework for tensor network circuit simulation at Exascale."
