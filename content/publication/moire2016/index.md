abstract = "Vortex lattices in rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein condensates lead to a periodic modulation of the superfluid density with a triangular symmetry. Here we show that this symmetry can be combined with an external perturbation in order to create super-lattice structures with two or more periodicities. Considering a condensate which is kicked by an optical lattice potential, we find the appearance of transient moiré lattice structures, which can be identified using the kinetic energy spectrum. "
