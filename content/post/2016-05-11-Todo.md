Granted I have not published any of the articles I am writing since my initial post, they are still in the works. Unfortunately, they will also  need to wait until my thesis has been written and published (as some of them will be used therein).

As a snapshot, I will intend to discuss the following topics:

- GPU acceleration of Schrodinger-like problems using [GPUE](https://github.com/mlxd/gpue)
- Implementing the pseudospectral Fourier split-operator method for time dependent simulations
- An easy introduction to simulation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)
- Numerically solving the Bogoliubov equations for BEC fun
- Playing with vortices in a BEC

However, do not hold your breath for these...
