[GPUE](https://github.com/gpue-group/gpue) represents the culmination of work by myself and [James Schloss](https://github.com/leios) into developing a high performance quantum dynamics simulator for investigating superfluid dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates. This solver allows for studies of 2D and 3D dynamics, quantum vortices, arbitrary potential geometries, artificial gauge fields, as well as a variety of additional features. The solver makes use of CUDA libraries and custom kernels to enable GPUE to simulate quantum systems faster than [competing suites or libraries](https://peterwittek.com/gpe-comparison.html), as well as Python routines for post-processing and data analysis. Documentation and example use-cases are available [here](https://gpue-group.github.io), with the API available [here](https://gpue-group.github.io/development/html/).

The work has been [peer-reviewed](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/1037) and [published](http://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01037) in the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS), and is cited as:
$\\textrm{Schloss and O'Riordan, (2018). GPUE: Graphics Processing Unit Gross--Pitaevskii Equation solver.}$ $\\textrm{Journal of Open Source Software, 3(32), 1037,}$ https://doi.org//10.21105/joss.01037.

Below are three sample videos from the 2D simulation code, showcasing a rapidly rotating BEC vortex lattice, subject to a variety of perturbations. Details of these works are available in the papers on [Moire superlattices](/publication/moire2016) and [defect engineering](/publication/defect2016) respectively.

## GPUE topics
The following pages discuss different aspects of the GPUE functionality. Much of the following can be found in the [documentation](https://gpue-group.github.io).

 - [2D BEC vortex tracking](/post/vortex_2d/): This explains the tracking and determination of vortex core positions from 2D complex scalar field data (aka a wavefunction in 2D).
 - [FFT along n-th dimension](/post/fft_nd/): For implementing the angular momentum operators, performing an FFT along individual dimensions of a multidimensional data set is necessary. This discusses our implementation in GPUE.
