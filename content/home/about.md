# Biography

My background is in theoretical physics, with experience in computational accelerators and data analytics. I am a PhD graduate of the [Quantum Systems Unit](https://groups.oist.jp/qsu) at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Japan. My PhD research included control and manipulation of quantum states, GPU and next-generation computing, and nonlinear dynamics. I am an author of the Bose-Einstein condensate simulation suite [GPUE](https://github.com/gpue-group/GPUE). My previous position was as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Computational Crystallography Initiative](cci.lbl.gov) at Lawrence Berkeley Lab, investigating the use of prototype exascale computing technologies for femtosecond X-ray crystallographic (XFEL) analysis of bio-molecular systems. My contributions to this project can be found at the following repositories: [CCTBX](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project), [DIALS](https://github.com/dials/dials) and [ExaFEL](https://github.com/exafel/exafel_project). I am currently exploring the use of near-term quantum computing technologies as a computational scientist with the [Irish Centre for High-End Computing](http://ichec.ie/) (ICHEC).
