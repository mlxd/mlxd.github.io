# Biography

I am a *PhD graduate* of the [Quantum Systems Unit](https://groups.oist.jp/qsu) at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Japan. My PhD research included control and manipulation of quantum states, GPU and HPC computing methods, and nonlinear dynamics. Following this I worked as a *postdoctoral researcher* in the [Computational Crystallography Initiative](cci.lbl.gov) at Lawrence Berkeley Lab, investigating the use of prototype exascale computing technologies for femtosecond X-ray crystallographic (XFEL) analysis of bio-molecular systems. I am currently a *computational scientist* with the [Irish Centre for High-End Computing](http://ichec.ie/) exploring the use of near-term quantum computing technologies.
