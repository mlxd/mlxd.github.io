I am senior computational scientist, with programming experience across academic research (scientific computing) and industry environments. I have several years experience as a polyglot developer, with expertise in C++ (11-20), Python, and Julia, and parallelisation using MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA. I also have expertise in modern development practices, including containerisation, cloud platforms, CI/CD, agile practices and performance engineering. I hold the title of "Senior Quantum Software Developer I" at [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai), where I lead the PennyLane Performance team, working on the the development of algorithms, methods and toolkits to offer the best performance of hybrid quantum work-flows.
