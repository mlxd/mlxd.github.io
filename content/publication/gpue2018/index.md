abstract = "GPUE is a Gross—Pitaevskii equation solver that is accelerated on GPU hardware with CUDA. The project began as a general method to study vortex dynamics in 2 dimensional Bose—Einstein Condensates (BECs), and has since grown into a general-purpose BEC simulator using the Split-Operator method for 1, 2, and 3 dimensions and allows for dynamic gauge fields and potentials.
